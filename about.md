I'm a developer interested in the intersection of art and code, procedural content generation, visual tools, and game&nbsp;design.  
<br>
I've worked as a full stack web developer using JavaScript, Ruby, and PostgreSQL. In a previous life, I was a professional Flash&nbsp;developer.  
<br>
I have a BFA in computer art from the State University of New York at&nbsp;Buffalo.
