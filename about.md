I'm a developer interested in the intersection of art and code,  
procedural content generation, visual tools, and game design.  
<br>
I've worked as a full stack web developer using Javascript,  
Ruby, and PostgreSQL. In a previous life, I was a  
professional Flash developer.  
<br>
I have a BFA in computer art from the  
State University of New York at Buffalo.
