title: Hacker School&#58; The First Two Weeks

#### Expectations

>Hack days are great!  
I would love to be in  
an environment where  
it's like a hack day  
but extended over  
3 months!

When I read about and applied to [Hacker School](https://www.hackerschool.com/), the environment that I was expecting was something like the hack days that we would have every quarter when I was working at [Paperless Post](https://www.paperlesspost.com/). My thought was, "Hack days are great! I would love to be in an environment where it's like a hack day but extended over 3 months!"  
  
#### Reality
I definitely haven't been disappointed being at Hacker School so far. The environment isn't quite like the daily hack day that I had expected. It's like a hack day, combined with an ongoing tech conference, combined with taking independent study classes in a regular school, along with a bunch of job and interview training.

#### Progress
##### Day 1
The first day was mostly spent attending orientation sessions and figuring out what I wanted to do.  
My pairing partner was [Ray Sohn](http://raysohn.com/) who has an art background like me. I suggested that we work on implementing L-Systems because I think they're really cool and visual. He had never heard of them and I had never implemented them so it was a pretty good project for us to work on together. We paired together on implementing the L-Systems examples on [the Wikipedia page for L-Systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system).  
The day culminated in dinner and an alumni panel at eBay.

##### Day 2
I started getting sick today and needed to sleep in.  
Pairing continued with Ray and we managed to finish implementing the rest of the Wikipedia L-Systems examples. I'll post in more detail about L-Systems in a separate blog post.

##### Day 3
The whole morning was spent setting up [Light Table](http://lighttable.com/) and getting used to the differences between Clojure and Scheme syntax while trying to work through the [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs) exercises from the first lesson of the [MIT class](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/).
Today was the first day of [Mel Chua](http://melchua.com/)'s residency at Hacker School. She gave a talk about the different learning styles of programmers and how they could potentially affect how we interact with each other. It helped me realize how I prefer to learn and made me more mindful in ways in which I could structure my learning.  
I was able to finish most of the exercises from the first lesson of SICP, but ended up going home with a massive migraine.

##### Day 4
Mel gave another talk today on Learning Research for Hackers. The talk covered learning technique, learning progression and how learning technique changes depending on level of progression. This was a great talk to supplement the talk from yesterday.      
I watched the second SICP lecture and started setting up my blog in Wordpress. It wasn't a very productive day today because I was starting to get a sore throat and was finding it hard to concentrate.

##### Friday and Weekend 
The weekend was spent resting and recovering so that I could hopefully have a productive second week. I was a little sad that my github progress was empty after four days of being green.

##### Day 5
After looking through the documentation and not feeling like learning a whole CMS, I ended up scrapping Wordpress. I went with hosting my blog on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) which uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) instead.  
Productivity was still low from fighting the remnants of the cold from last week. I spent my time hanging out in the hardware room absorbing information that happened to be discussed in there. I learned about what happens after you turn on a PC up until a program runs.

##### Day 6
I tried to work on SICP today, but my mind wasn't in it. I did manage to find a favorite working spot though which has helped me feel much more productive ever since.  
The big success of the day was helping Libby Kent run through her presentation on [monads](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_%28functional_programming%29). It's one of those things you keep hearing about as being really a hard concept to grasp in computer science and once you understand it, it's really hard to explain. So I finally felt I was able to understand what they are, but of course I'm not at the point where I can explain what they are.

##### Day 7
There are still a ton of things I would like to explore with L-Systems  
so I started working on a general implementation along with an  
interactive interface.  
I wanted my implementation to be portable so it's in Javascript with data stored in a compact format in the url hash. Today was spent figuring out a data format and writing the decoder for the data format.

##### Day 8
The L-Systems project now has drawing functionality and can render data in the url hash into an image in the browser.

#### Next Steps
As I'm writing this, I'm in the middle of my fourth week at Hacker School. If I don't get this out I'm not going to remember what I did last week and will end up dropping the ball on writing blog posts completely. Keeping up good git commit practices has helped me remember what I did and has been a good way of keeping track of where I've been.

I'm going to end this post now before it ends up being the blog post version of a [pre-taped call in show](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrlS9_n8GX4) ;)
